## What is Binary Tree Data Structure?

![Alt text](https://zupimages.net/up/23/37/zi9o.png)

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with each node having at most two children. It's used for efficient data organization and various applications in computer science, including search algorithms, expression parsing, and file systems.

## Requirements
compile and run the programs with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Holbiwan/holbertonschool-binary_trees.git
```
## File Structure
The Binary Trees project includes the following key files:
```
Binary_trees.h: Header file containing function prototypes and the definition of the binary_tree_t type.

*.c: C source files implementing the binary tree functions.
```
