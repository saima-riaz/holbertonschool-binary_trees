## What is Binary Tree Data Structure?

![Alt text](https://zupimages.net/up/23/37/mo5b.png)

A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges, with each node having at most two children. It's used for efficient data organization and various applications in computer science, including search algorithms, expression parsing, and file systems.

## Requirements
compile and run the programs with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/Holbiwan/holbertonschool-binary_trees.git
```

- `push`: pushes an element to the stack.
- `pall`: prints all the values on the stack.
- `pint`: prints the value at the top of the stack.
- `pop`: removes the top element of the stack.
- `swap`: swaps the top two elements of the stack.
- `add`: adds the top two elements of the stack.
- `nop`: doesnâ€™t do anyth
